# progetto_asd_problema_1
Repository for Algorithm and Data Strutctures 's exam.

The problem to solve was about a serie of islands shaken by an earthquake.
These islands had a previous number of bridges but some of them were destroyed.
The request was to find the minimum number of bridges and at the minimum expense to rebuild to connect all the islands.
To solve the problem I considered the islands as nodes and the bridges as edges in a graph so to use the "minimum spanding tree".
